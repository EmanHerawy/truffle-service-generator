------------
To save your time :) 


# to use

- you can use it inside any truffle project , run `truffle migrate`  then `truffle-generate ` it will take the default contract artifacts you can spacify the provider through this flag `--provider` or `-p` otherwise , it will take the default `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
